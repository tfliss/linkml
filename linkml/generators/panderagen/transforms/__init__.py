"""This package supports conversion in serialization of a model.
   For example a column that is inlined as a simple dictionary may be converted to
   an inlined list form.

   The Pandera and PolaRS dataframe libraries are often much more efficient with
   certain forms, while other forms make more sense for viewing or export to JSON.
